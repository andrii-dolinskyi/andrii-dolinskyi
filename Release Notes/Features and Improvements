| RQ20884    | In the **Date Format Editor**, a space delimiter can now be used to split the date and time. |
| RQ20885    | Now you can associate SDTM DSP Logical category standards with other standards so other applications (e.g., DSP) can find linked standards by request. |
| RQ21141    | When an SDTM DSP Logical category standard with associated standards is sent for review and approval, the associated standards are also sent for review and approval. |
| RQ21170    | In the **Copy standard to target hierarchy** form, you can now select other standards to associate with the SDTM DSP Logical category standard being copied. |

| RQ21528    | All existing code lists have been moved to their respective controlled terminologies, which now exist as separate entities. |
| RQ21544    | You can manage code lists within the controlled terminology to which they belong. This includes viewing details, editing, adding to bookmarks, copying to another hierarchy level, duplicating, comparing code lists and their versions, downloading in ODM or XLS format, and deleting. |
| RQ21545    | You can associate a code list with a data element. |
| RQ21546    | Now it is possible to create standards from ODM files that contain domains with no data elements. It is also possible to download standards as ODM files even if they contain domains with no data elements. |
| RQ21547    | The system no longer sends events of the "MDR_BlindingRulesUpdated" type when blinding rules for a standard are created, updated, or deleted, as other processes make this unnecessary. |
| RQ21548    | Now it is possible to send standards with associated controlled terminology for review and approval. |
| RQ21549    | Now it is possible to duplicate standards, domains, and data elements with associated controlled terminology. |

| RQ21551    | When creating a standard from an existing one (i.e., copying a standard), the controlled terminology associated with the original standard is also copied, maintaining the association. |
| RQ21552    | The system can now return the URL with the path to a study upon request from other applications. |
| RQ21553    | Now it is possible to create, edit, and delete controlled terminology at the **Industry** level at the platform-level division. |
