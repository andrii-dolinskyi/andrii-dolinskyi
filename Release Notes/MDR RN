# MDR Release Notes

A brief of the major changes introduced in the Metadata Repository (MDR) application includes the following:

- **The STUDY DAY CALCULATION function.** A new function has been introduced that can be applied to the source data elements when configuring data transformations. The **STUDY DAY CALCULATION** function enables the calculation of a study day based on the event and the referenced date defined.

- **The AGE CALCULATION function.** A new function has been introduced that can be applied to the source data elements when configuring data transformations. The **AGE CALCULATION** function enables the calculation of the age based on the subject's birth date and the referenced date defined.

- **The Ready for Testing status.** A new status has been introduced for standards so the study data can be tested without sending the standard for review and approval.

- **The Impact Analysis function improvements.** The report generated by the function has been majorly updated. Now the function enables analyzing a standard to understand what child entities must be updated to maintain consistency with the parent standard.

- **The Dependency Analysis function improvements.** The report generated by the function has been majorly updated. Now the function enables the analysis of a standard, domain, or data element to understand where the standard, domain, or data element is being used.

- **Creation from a local file.** Now it is possible to create a standard or a controlled terminology from a file stored on your device.

- **Validation rule creation improvements.** Now at the start of the validation rule creation process, you need to answer some questions about your goals so the system offers you suitable rule templates. Also, later in the process, you can configure some new issue attributes to ensure the needed issue generation as a result of your validation rule application.

- **Data processing improvements.** The **Data Processing Type** property is now used instead of the **Data Type** property to facilitate Batch processing of the mappings configured in MDR.

- **Control terminology improvements.** Controlled terminology has been separated from standards and now can be created and managed on its own. A standard can be associated with a CT package and updated to point to another CT package or another version of the same CT package at any time. CT packages must be approved for use in the same way as standards.
