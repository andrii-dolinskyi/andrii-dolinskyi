## CONFORM Full Flow Guide

There can be many different scenarios on how the data can be acquired and processed in CONFORM. The main purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the main features of cross-CONFORM applications and their interrelationship when creating a new client environment. This manual describes only one example scenario.

The following is a sample scenario explaining how the CONFORM full flow may be implemented and executed:
