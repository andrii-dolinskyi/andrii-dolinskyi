# Conversion Definitions

The diversity of data sources and tools involved in clinical research often leads to inconsistencies in data representation. Different labs and medical facilities that identify as sites can use varying units for the same measurements (for example, milliliters versus ounces, Fahrenheit versus Celsius), leading to challenges in data interpretation. Additionally, subject data may require standardization to align with medical coding terms from established dictionaries like *MedDRA4* or *WHODrug4*.

Data standardization is crucial for compiling unified and coherent datasets. The data conversion and standardization in compliance with industry regulations. This automation not only ensures that data from disparate sources is compatible for analysis but also eliminates the need for manual adjustments to the raw data.

The process of configuring the automated conversion can be done with a variety of **tools** as follows:

- **Raw data coding**: to apply the coding for the conversion of specific data into medical terms in compliance with the *MedDRA4* or *WHODrug4* dictionary. You can then define a mapping for domain keys so the standardized data is generated in separate columns.

- **Lab master units**: to view a comprehensive master table that showcases the standard measurement units used for lab data collected in different forms across various study visits. The table serves as a definitive guide for converting test and assay results into a standardized format, ensuring consistency in data interpretation and analysis.

- **Lab grading**: to enable a standardized grading system when interpreting lab results. The lab-grading system is hardcoded in the file by **You can either activate this file or upload your custom if you need to use the industry-regulated lab grading system to identify toxicity levels in subjects' tests and assays during raw data generation.**

- **Vital signs master units**: to view a master table with formulas for converting vital signs measurements from the imperial to the metric system. You can also specify variables that require metric system measurements. During the raw data generation process, automatically performs these conversions from imperial to metric units, ensuring data consistency across the study.

- **Raw data generation**: to generate raw data in a ZIP package after the necessary data standardization and conversion settings have been applied. The raw data is converted according to the defined configuration before being compiled into datasets. You can then share the generated package containing datasets with other teams, clinicians, or third-party data analysts.

*It is not mandatory to use all available data standardization and conversion instruments before generating the raw data package. You can apply only those conversion settings that are relevant to your specific research objectives or data requirements.*
